# remarked [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/remarked.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/remarked)

> Markdown parser and lexer (fork of marked.js).

## Install

#### [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i remarked --save
```

## Goals

- [x] Unit tests
- [ ] Better test coverage (started). Many more tests are needed, I'd also like to move the code inline instead of reading from files wherever reasonable.
- [x] Cleaner more organized code-base (started)
- [ ] Well-commented code
- [ ] Remove extra tags/attributes from generated HTML (e.g. heading ids) (started)
- [ ] Refactor options handling
- [ ] Allow extensions/plugins

## Why?

Assemble used marked.js extensively, but given the massive amount of time and effort that we've put into fixing marked-related issues (due to breaking changes that were introduced without bumping the minor version), we've decided to maintain a fork so that our user base can have a more reliable experience going forward.
