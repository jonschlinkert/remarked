# remarked [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/remarked.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/remarked)

> Markdown parser and lexer (fork of marked.js).

## Install

#### [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i remarked --save
```

## Why?

Assemble used marked.js extensively, but given the massive amount of time and effort that we've put into fixing marked-related issues (due to breaking changes that are introduced to marked.js without bumping the minor version), we've decided to maintain a fork so that our user base can have a more reliable experience going forward.
