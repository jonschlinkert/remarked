## Project goals:

Most of these goals are focused on making the project easier to maintain and contribute to:

- [x] Unit tests
- [ ] Better test coverage (started). Many more tests are needed, I'd also like to move the code inline instead of reading from files wherever reasonable.
- [x] Cleaner more organized code-base (started)
- [ ] Well-commented code
- [ ] Remove extra tags/attributes from generated HTML (e.g. heading ids) (started)
- [ ] Refactor options handling
- [ ] Allow extensions/plugins
