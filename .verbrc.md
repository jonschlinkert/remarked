## Project goals:

Most of these goals are focused on making the project easier to maintain and contribute to (than marked.js is):

- [ ] Unit tests, better coverage (started). Many more tests are needed, I'd also like to move the code inline instead of reading from files wherever reasonable.
- [ ] Cleaner more organized code-base (started)
- [ ] Don't clutter HTML with unwanted junk (started)
- [ ] Refactor options handling
- [ ] Allow extensions/plugins
